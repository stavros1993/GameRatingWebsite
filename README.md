# GameRatingWebsite

Dynamic Website whose main purpose is for the users to rate or add popular videogames.

There's a map page which uses markers to show some points of interest like the location of videogame developers' headquarters 
and stadiums that host gaming tournaments. The user can choose which kind of markers will be shown on the map.

This site presents popular videogames in a dynamic list by using pictures and links to related websites. The visitor can choose
to view only specific videogames based on their genre. A TOP 5 list is generated based on the ratings, which can be viewed by the 
visitor.

The visitors can rate videogames based on a few core aspects, and if they're registered members, they can also add new games
to the rating list. A user can only rate the same game once based on their IP address.

There's also a simple contact page which allows the visitor to send feedback to the administrator.
